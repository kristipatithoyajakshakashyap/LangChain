During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders.

Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation.

He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences, highlighting 10 important messages that he learned during his tenure. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agriculture for growth\n",

      "7. Defending the nation with pride\n",
      "8. Promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He specifically mentions a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020, and how it inspired him to think about the country's development. The speech is a reflection on his time in office and a call to action for the people of India to work towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the nation's highest institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker reflects on their experiences visiting villages, including a trip to Nagaland, where they saw the positive impact of empowering village councils with financial powers and decision-making abilities. The speaker also highlights the importance of providing physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable villages to access markets and develop economically. Additionally, the speaker mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) complex, providing health care, education, and vocational training to 65 villages, resulting in employment generation and entrepreneurship. The overall theme of the speech is the need to empower villages and provide connectivity to unlock the potential of rural India and achieve national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the help of self-help groups. The project has developed wasteland into cultivable land, promoting sustainable economic development through activities like cultivation, power generation, and food processing. Additionally, the project has collaborated with Japanese experts to develop internationally competitive products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the local people. The speaker emphasizes the need for similar projects (PURA) to bridge the rural-urban divide, estimating that 7000 such projects are required across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker reflects on two inspiring experiences. Firstly, they met with over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker believes that with the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries, the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who despite his disabilities, exuded confidence and happiness. Krishna Murthy attributed his positive outlook to the support of his family, teachers, and others, and expressed his desire to sing in front of the speaker, demonstrating his determination to overcome his challenges. These experiences have given the speaker confidence in the nation's potential for growth and the importance of empowering individuals to succeed despite adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two inspiring stories. The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his limitations, has developed a talent for music with the support of his parents, teachers, and others. He has even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre, and now wants to share his art with others to inspire them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and was impressed by the courage and resilience of the people, who were grateful for the relief efforts provided by the Army, Air Force, and state government. The villagers had become determined to overcome their problems, rather than letting their problems overcome them. The speech highlights the importance of a positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a leader or dignitary, possibly a president or prime minister, who is sharing their experiences and observations of people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker mentions visiting villages affected by earthquakes and tsunamis, where they witnessed the bravery and determination of the people, including children and tribal leaders. They also share a poem they composed, called \"Sea Waves\", which they sang with the villagers, and express admiration for the way the community came together to support each other. The speech also touches on the importance of connectivity and societal transformation, referencing an address to the Pan African Parliament. Overall, the speech is a tribute to the human spirit and its ability to overcome adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 super specialty hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, providing tele-education and tele-medicine services, including an MBA course for Ethiopian students and access to specialist care from India's CARE Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses three main topics: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India's international collaboration**: The speaker highlights India's collaboration with Africa, specifically in the fields of cardiology and radiology, where Indian doctors are providing tele-consultation services to a hospital in Addis Ababa. This partnership aims to bring societal transformation to the African continent using technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, sharing personal experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, being on a submarine, and flying in a fighter jet. The speaker praises the bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty of India's soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who work tirelessly to protect the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for a developed India**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\". This initiative aims to contribute to India's development by empowering its youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become disciplined, responsible, and patriotic. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who was inspired by the training to help her father quit smoking, demonstrating the positive impact of the program. The speech concludes by emphasizing the need to empower the 540 million youth in India through value-based education and leadership, and expresses optimism about the country's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the country's hardworking people, particularly its 540 million youth. The speech highlights the need for empowerment and equal opportunities for all, and outlines a vision for a developed India with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Equitable distribution of energy and water\n",
      "* Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "* Access to education with a value system for all meritorious candidates\n",
      "* A hub for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker encourages citizens to work together to achieve this vision, inspired by the idea that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes a vision for a nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",
      "* Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A society where everyone feels included and valued\n",
      "* Overall prosperity, health, security, peace, and happiness, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, where he expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support and cooperation over the last five years. He shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society and to instill self-confidence in its people. He vows to continue working towards making India a developed nation by 2020 and ends with a blessing and the phrase \"Jai Hind\" (Long live India).\n",

       "'The new context provided adds a few more details to the existing summary, but it does not significantly alter the overall message. However, it does include a 10th point to Kalam\\'s vision for a developed India and reiterates his commitment to the mission. Here\\'s a refined summary incorporating the new context:\\n\\nIn his departing speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his 5-year tenure as President, thanking various groups for their association. He shares his vision for a developed India by 2020, inspired by a question from a young girl who asked why India can\\'t become a developed nation before 2020. This aspiration is echoed by the 540 million youth of the nation, whom he believes should be guided by the desire to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. He emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, citing his experience in Nagaland and initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women\\'s Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex. The PURA complex demonstrates a sustainable economic development model, where 1000 self-help groups have generated employment and created entrepreneurs, developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and enabled the production of various products. Kalam stresses the need for 7000 such PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide, promoting agricultural growth and development.\\n\\nKalam also highlights the importance of preserving India\\'s rich and diverse cultural treasures while pursuing economic growth. He expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth and the hard work of its people. He resolves to continue working towards realizing the mission of a developed India 2020, with a distinctive profile that includes:\\n\\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line.\\n2. A Nation with equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water.\\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry, and service sector work together in symphony.\\n4. A Nation where education with a value system is not denied to any meritorious candidate.\\n5. A Nation that is the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\\n6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all.\\n7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free.\\n8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and crimes against women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated.\\n9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy and continues with a sustainable growth path.\\n10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership.\\n\\nKalam concludes his address by thanking the citizens for their love and affection and reiterates his mission to bring connectivity between the hearts and minds of the people of India, embedding self-confidence that \"we can do it.\" He assures the citizens that he will always be with them in the great mission of making India a developed nation before 2020. Overall, Kalam\\'s speech emphasizes the need for collective effort to achieve a developed India by 2020, with a focus on empowering villages, preserving cultural heritage, and promoting sustainable economic growth.'"
